        <h2>Introduction: Getting Started</h2>
        <p>This Todo-App helps a user to generate a list of items/ tasks to be carried out, filter through, and delete list
          items from the log.</p>
        <p>The app also gives the flexibility of marking each Todo Items as either active or completed, and display/filter corresponding
          Todo Items based on all, active or completed Todo list.</p>
        <p>It also has a feature that clears all completed Todos from the list array.</p>
        <p>The architecture of the application was built using plain JavaScript which is commonly referred to as Vanilla JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>Technical Guide</h3>
        <p>The Todo App is built using the
          <span class="text-danger">Model</span> -
          <span class="text-danger">View</span> -
          <span class="text-danger">Controller</span> Architecture design.
          <p>The MVC pattern is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related
            program logic into three interconnected elements. This pattern is used to separate application's concerns.</p>
          <p>Model, View and the Controller are separate entities. The
            <strong>Controller</strong> serves as the intermidiary between the
            <strong>Model</strong> and the
            <strong>View</strong>, thereby making it the only entity that can interact with the both. See the picture below for more
            information.

          <h5>The Model-View-Controller (MVC)</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Model</strong>: Model is responsible for managing the data of the application. </li>
            <li>
              <strong>View</strong>: View is a presentation of the model in a particular format - in our case displaying All, Active
              or Completed todos (route). It also let user to interact with displayed data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Controller</strong>: Controller responds to the user input from View and performs interactions with Model.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Todo App Structure</h5>
          <p>The Todo App is made up of the following structure, which are: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>index.html: </strong>The file provides the structure needed by the Todo App.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>index.css &amp; base.css: </strong>These two files helped us to present the layout and look of our Todo App
              in a more appealing manner.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>JavaScript Folder: </strong>This folder comprises of all javascript files used in the Todo App. They are as
              follows:
              <ul>
                <li>app.js: The Model, View and Controller were initialized in the app.js file. It manages the user actions and
                  connects the View with the Model in terms of interactions and operations.</li>
                <li>controller.js: This is where all the logic implementation of the Todo App features is handled. It is the
                  link between the model and view.</li>
                <li>helpers.js: This delivers helper functions for DOM elements - querying, wrapping, delegating events</li>
                <li>model.js: Data Management Methods</li>
                <li>store.js: This help us to have data persistent using local storage.</li>
                <li>template.js: This function displays list items, change button states, escape characters</li>
                <li>view.js : This defines how the data will be displayed on the client side of the Todo
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>test folder: </strong>This contains the files for bith the Todo App test file (ControllerSpec.js) and test
              runner (SpecRunner.html).</li>
            <li>
              <strong>gitignore file: </strong>This file includes the names of all the files and folders we do not want to add to
              github
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>package.json file: </strong>This contains the names of dependencies needed for our Todo App to function optimally.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>license.md: </strong>This contains the permission access of the Todo App.</li>
          </ul>

              <p>
                <strong>Frame Rate</strong>: The main metric for measuring the performance of any animation is frames per second
                (FPS). Optimum User experience is achieved when animations run at 60 FPS.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>First Contentful Paint</strong>: The First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric measures the time from when the
                page starts loading to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen. For this metric, "content"
                refers to text, images (including background images),
                <svg> elements, or non-white
                  <canvas> elements.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Largest Contentful Paint</strong>: The (LCP) metric reports the render time of the largest image or text
                block visible within the viewport. A good user experience within the first 2.5 seconds when the page started
                to load.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Waterfall</strong>: This gives insight into the sorts of things the browser is doing as it runs your site
                or app.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Call Tree</strong>: The Call Tree tells which JavaScript functions the browser spent the most time in. By
                analyzing its results, one can find bottlenecks in one's code - places where the browser is spending a disproportionately
                large amount of time.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Total Time: is that number translated into milliseconds, based on the total amount of time covered by the
                  selected portion of the recording.</li>
                <li>Total Cost is that number as a percentage of the total number of samples in the selected portion of the recording.</li>
                <li>Self Time is calculated as the time spent in that particular function, excluding its children.</li>
                <li>Self Cost is calculated from Self Time as a percentage of the total number of samples in the selected portion
                  of the recording.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>

              <!-- Expand the Main section. DevTools shows you a flame chart of activity on the main thread, over time. The
                x-axis represents the recording, over time. Each bar represents an event. A wider bar means that event took
                longer. The y-axis represents the call stack. When you see events stacked on top of each other, it means
                the upper events caused the lower events. The Animation Frame Fired event has a red triangle, indicating
                a warning that there may be an issue related to this event. The Animation Frame Fired event occurs whenever
